# 3rd Party Code

This directory just contains a zip of the version of Pyro I ran my experiments with. Use at your own discretion. The parts of pyro I was using were fairly bleeding-edge at the time, so I figured it'd be good to keep a copy just in case.

To use, it's probably something like this:
```

    unzip pyrothesis.zip /path/to/destination

    cd /path/to/destination

    pip install .
