This repository includes all of the code used in my master's thesis. 

# Comments about code

I should probably add this in every file I use code from, but if you want a concise tutorial (and good place to bootstrap your own work from) here's a link to the jupyter notebook I built off of :

b/bastings/annotated_encoder_decoder/blob/master/annotated_encoder_decoder.ipynb

For being closer to the state where I ran experiments use commit cd43adb49f135c17d8bdb99ffac2ab24b6d18cb7 although I suspect for the most part you can still get results close to my original runs with whatever the latest one is.
